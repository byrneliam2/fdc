# fdc
Intended to be a simple command-line based calculator/generator-thing for use with functional dependencies. Currently supports calculating closures, computing minimal covers and determining normal forms (1 through to BCNF.) May also be extended to include other fun stuff from the world of relational database design.

This is a personal project made to help out with my studies in relational database theory and also to be my Ruby practice playground.
