# fdc
Intended to be a simple command-line based calculator/generator-thing for use with functional dependencies. Currently supports calculating closures, computing minimal covers and determining normal forms (1 through to BCNF.) 

This is a personal project made to help out with my studies in relational database theory and also to be my Ruby practice playground.

### Running FDC

Check the batch files to see the console commands to run FDC. Use `fdc --help` or `fdc -h` to get a list of commands.
